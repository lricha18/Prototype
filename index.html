When the right arrow key is pressed, the player will move to the right. When they player is resting on the ground, the up arrow key may be pressed to make the player jump. The game camera is also moving to the right causing the player to run as they catch stars. The game gets progressively harder as the player gets more points by speeding up the camera's movement.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is most close to the Starstruck Phaser example. This game was built using Starstuck to animate the running and jumping. This game also uses out of world detection for the stars falling just as the bullets do in the Phaser Invaders example.
