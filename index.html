<li><strong>Genre:</strong>

This game include a player that can move left and right and may jump if they are on the ground. The player includes an animation for the left and right movements.

When the right arrow key is pressed, the player will move to the right. When they player is resting on the ground, the up arrow key may be pressed to make the player jump. The game camera is also moving to the right causing the player to run as they catch stars. The game gets progressively harder as the player gets more points by speeding up the camera's movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating arrow key presses, object collisions, world bound collisions, and playing sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game has off camera detection for the player. Each frame the game checks if the player has left the camera view and if they have the game is ended. Camera movement that gets progressively faster will make the player run faster to keep up.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is most close to the Starstruck Phaser example. This game was built using Starstuck to animate the running and jumping. This game also uses out of world detection for the stars falling just as the bullets do in the Phaser Invaders example.
